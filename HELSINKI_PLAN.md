# Plan for TPC Spring Hackathon Data Pipelines Team

*May 6-8, Helsinki, Finland*

This hackathon will deepen and build on the code in this repo, which is a workflow that generates
training data in the form of Multiple Choice Question and Answers (MCQA) from scientific papers.

Please switch to the sauna-hack branch to see the Helsinki plan.
